## Overview

This project provides a simulation environment that can be used to evaluate a scalable collection of Global Network Access Terminals (GNATs), a concept under investigation as part of the Space Combat Cloud Project. . The environment is used to simulate a mesh network of satellites/GPS systems connected to work in tandem. Docker containers are used to represent each satellite and OVS is used to interconnect them to form a communication network. Each satellite encloses multiple nested Docker containers designated to act as components and interconnected via OVS.
